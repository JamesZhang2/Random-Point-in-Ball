# How to Find a Random Point in a High Dimensional Ball

![Thumbnail](manim/project/images/thumbnail.png)

This is my video project for the [Summer of Math Exposition 2 (SoME2)](https://summerofmathexposition.substack.com/p/the-summer-of-math-exposition-is) competition hosted by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown).

This project was inspired by Justin's video, ["The BEST Way to Find a Random Point in a Circle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y_nmpv-9lI), which was one of the honorable mentions in last year's Summer of Math Exposition competition. It was also inspired by two of the courses that I took at Cornell: CS 4850 and MATH 2240. In this project, I extended Justin's results and discussed how to find a uniform random point in a high-dimensional ball.

This GitHub repo contains my script in LaTeX, my Manim code for the animations, and my Jupyter notebook code for the simulations.
